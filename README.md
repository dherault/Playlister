Hapi / RethinkDb <-- http / websocket --> Redux / React

I closed this project in favor of a serverless architecture.
It features several back ends (rendering, API, redis, websocket, image transformation, ...) and focuses on DX (developper experience). 
This web app has no custom features, only login/logout and so on. It is very opiniated (ex: the API gets constructed from actionCreators, lots of defaults, etc...).
